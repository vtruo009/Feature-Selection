1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Ellimination
3. Van's Special Algorithm

This dataset has 40 features (not including the class attribute), with 1000 instnaces.

Please wait while I normalize the data... Done!

Running nearest neighbor with no features (default rate), using "leave-one-out" evaluation, I get an accuracy of 81%
